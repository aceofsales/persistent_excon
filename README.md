# PersistentExcon

Squatting in this namespace for a future refactor of https://github.com/aceofsales/faraday_persistent_excon to remove the faraday bits.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'persistent_excon'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install persistent_excon

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
